## Key Architectural Differences

### BMAD Agent Architecture
- **Hierarchical Structure**: Clear role-based hierarchy with defined responsibilities
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Direct human collaboration and oversight
- **Document-Centric**: Agents communicate through structured documents and files
- **Sequential Workflow**: Agents work in planned sequences with handoffs
- **Limited Agent Count**: 7 specialized agents with clear boundaries

### Pheromind Agent Architecture  
- **Swarm Intelligence**: Decentralized coordination through pheromone signals
- **Autonomous Operation**: Minimal human intervention during execution
- **Signal-Based Communication**: Digital pheromone trails for coordination
- **Emergent Behavior**: Self-organizing task allocation and problem-solving
- **Massive Agent Pool**: 50+ specialized agents for comprehensive coverage

## Hybrid Opportunity for Pronetheia

**Recommended Agent Integration Strategy:**
1. **Adopt BMAD Planning Agents** for structured project initiation
2. **Implement Pheromind Swarm Agents** for autonomous execution
3. **Bridge with Meta-Orchestrators** to manage phase transitions
4. **Maintain Human Oversight** through planning agent interfaces
5. **Enable Pheromone Communication** for execution phase coordination
