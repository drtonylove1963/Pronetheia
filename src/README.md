# Pronetheia Phase 0.1 - SEED
## Agent-Native Bootstrap Self-Evolution Platform

**Version:** 0.1-GENESIS  
**Status:** Ready for Implementation  
**Target:** Bootstrap Self-Evolution Platform

---

## üå± Overview

Pronetheia Phase 0.1 "SEED" is the genesis version of a self-evolving AI development platform featuring a foundational 3-agent architecture with integrated MCP (Model Context Protocol) functionality. This agent-native bootstrap contains the essential multi-agent DNA and tool integration capabilities needed for the system to analyze itself, coordinate specialized tasks, and iteratively enhance its own functionality through recursive self-improvement.

### üéØ Core Vision
Start with foundational agent architecture (3 agents + 5 MCP tools), then use agent coordination and evolution capabilities to build increasingly sophisticated multi-agent features in a continuous self-evolution cycle.

## üéâ Evolution Milestone

**The key success indicator for Phase 0.1 is when the EvolutionAgent successfully:**
1. Analyzes the current system capabilities
2. Identifies the need for a ProjectManagementAgent
3. Generates the code for this new agent
4. Validates and deploys it
5. Integrates it into the coordination system

This proves the agent evolution concept and establishes the foundation for unlimited agent expansion.

**Next Evolution**: After successful deployment, the EvolutionAgent will use its analysis capabilities to identify additional agent needs and begin the autonomous agent creation cycle, evolving into the sophisticated multi-agent swarm envisioned in the complete Pronetheia platform.

## üöÄ **This is not just building software - this is creating the seed of agent-native intelligence that will grow itself into the future of collaborative AI development.**
